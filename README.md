The Django Book

In this repository I will share the codes in the book and my notes. For each chapter I will have a branch. The notes can be found in Wiki of this repository. 
The codes and notes will be directly copy from the book. Since I declara this here, I will not submit the source of the notes 
as I did in my old repositories.
