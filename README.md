The Django Book

In this repository I will share the codes in the book and my notes. For each chapter I will have a branch. The notes can be found in Wiki of this repository. 
The codes and notes will be directly copied from the book. Since I declare this here, I will not submit the source of the notes 
as I did in my old repositories.    

In the book the chapters are described as the following:   
"Chapters 1 through 6 are the “core curriculum,” Chapters 7 through 12 cover more advanced Django usage, and Chapter 13 covers deployment. The remaining chapters, 14 through 21, focus on specific Django features and can be read in any order."
